# If..Else
The if statement executes a statement if a specified condition is truth
If the condition is false, another statement can be executed.

The if statement specifies a block of code to be executed if a condition is true:

```  if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} 
```

The else statement specifies a block of code to be executed if the condition is false:

 ``` if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is false
} 
```

The else if statement specifies a new condition if the first condition is false:

``` if (condition1) {
  // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
} 
```

# Switch Statement

The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.



```
switch(expression) {
  case x:
    // code block
    break;
  case y:
    // code block
    break;
  default:
    // code block
}
```

# While Loop
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

```
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```
# Do-While Loop
This loop will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is false, because the code block is executed before the condition is tested:

```
var text = "";
var i = 0;
do {
  text += "The number is " + i;
  i++;
}
while (i < 5);
```
# For Loop
Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.

Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

```
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

# For of Loop
