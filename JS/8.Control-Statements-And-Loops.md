# If..Else
The if statement executes a statement if a specified condition is truth
If the condition is false, another statement can be executed.

The if statement specifies a block of code to be executed if a condition is true:

```  if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} ```

The else statement specifies a block of code to be executed if the condition is false:

``` if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is false
} ```

The else if statement specifies a new condition if the first condition is false:

``` if (condition1) {
  // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
} ```
