# Difference between null vs undefined?
- example:
-            null:
-                    var andy = null;
-                    console.log(andy);             // value assigned null
-                    output: null
-            undefined:
-                        var extraplayer = undefined;        // No value has been assigned
-                        console.log(andy2);
-                        output: undefined 
### Js bugs
- if you subtract int and string it will not concate
- if you find type of null variable it will give object as output

# NAN
- Not a Number, example: if we subtract two strings.
- NaN is a property of the global object.
 In other words, it is a variable in global scope.
- The initial value of NaN is Not-A-Number.
- also be used console.log(isNaN(...));
