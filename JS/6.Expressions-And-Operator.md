- based on the value of its right operand.
- The simple assignment operator is equal (=)

# Arithmetic operators
- An arithmetic operator takes numerical values
- (either literals or variables) as their operandsan
- returns a single numerical value.
- console.log(10+12);
- console.log(15-10);
- console.log(25/5);

- Equal (==)
- Not Equal (!=)
- Greater than (>)

# Logical operators
- Logical operators are typically used with boolean (logical) values.
### Logical And (&&) 
- The logical AND (&&) operator (logical conjuntion) for a set of operands is true if and only if all of its operands are true.
### Logical OR (||)
- Operands is true if and only if one or more of its operands is true.
### Logical NOT (!)
- true or false
# String Contatenation operators
- The concatenation operation (+) conctenates two strings values together returning another string that is the union of the two operand strings.
# Conditional (ternary) operator
- i
